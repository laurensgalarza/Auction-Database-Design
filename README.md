# Online Auction DBMS
Term Project for Data Base Management Course (CSCI 435). No code in this repo to comply with Hunter College's academic honesty policy.

## Summary
I developed a database management system to manage bidding, auctions, and sales of goods and services on an online platform, inspired by eBay. 

It contains 8 entites (User, Auction, Transaction, Bid, etc.) and 10+ relationships (User's Place Bids, Transactions End Auctions, etc.).

## Project Milestones

1. Identified appropriate `entities`, `relationships`, `attributes`, `domains`, and `keys` as well as all `specializations` and `generalizations`
2. Produced an `Entity-Relationship Diagram`
3. Mapped and Normalized

   a. Mapped the ERD to a `relational database model`
   
   b. `Normalized` the database to 3NF
   
   c. Listed the integrity constraints for each table

4. Defined the database using `MySQL`
   
   a. Created the tables in a MySQL database
   
   b. Inserted sample data
   
   c. Wrote and executed test queries to ensure correct insertion and interactions
